    <h1>Hi, I'm Jonathan</h1>
    <p class="cipher-text">Systems are only as strong as the trust they uphold.</p>
    <p>I originally chose the name Trust-Worthy because it was available. 
      Over time, it evolved into a philosophy — trust isn't optional in secure systems; it's foundational. 
      As I deepened my work in cryptography, cybersecurity, and interpretable AI, 
      the name came to reflect a mission: building systems that defend, rather than exploit, their users.</p>
    <p>I focus on privacy-preserving, security-conscious, and sustainable software design. 
      My goal is to create tools that are ethically aligned, technically sound, and resilient in a hostile world. 
      Code is power — but trust is the vector.</p>
